  bio: "When I began my undergraduate journey, I had little knowledge about Computer Science and limited communication skills. However, after my first year, I realized the need to challenge myself and grow both technically and personally.I proactively learned Web Development, started applying for internships, and steadily built my technical foundation. Entering my third year, I took on leadership roles in club activities, which helped me significantly improve my communication skills, teamwork, and technical expertise. Today, I continue to embrace learning, leadership, and personal development, always striving to be better than yesterday",
